# Unscramble!

## Introduction

I am currently attending a 12-week web development bootcamp.  After the first two weeks of classes (which covered HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, jQuery and object-oriented programming), we were tasked to create a game using JavaScript.

To challenge myself and test my understanding of creating methods and functions and manipulating a DOM, I chose a game which was heavy on logic.

I chose to digitise a toy I enjoyed playing with when I was a child - picture courtesy of Pinterest:

## The game

The game grid consists of 16 spaces and 15 tiles.

The aim of the game is to move the tiles around the board so that they appear in numerical or alphabetical order.
